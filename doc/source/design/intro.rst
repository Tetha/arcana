Arcana design
=============

In Arcana, the player takes the role of a young guy who just joined the guild
of the mechanical artificers. Mechanical artificers are guys who use beams,
arcane smelting and other methods to build magical machines for whomever
has the right money.  Throughout the game, the player progresses from an 
inexperienced artificer without much responsibility to a grand artificer
building vast, complex machines, involving multiple kinds of machines
and magic systems 

The actual gameplay of Arcana presents the player with a number of branching
levels to choose from. These levels are progressively unlocked by completing
earlier levels. After the player has selected a level, the game transists
into the machine building view. The machine building view presents the 
player with a grid of tiles and a toolbox, and presents the player with specific
goals of this level, for example 'provide me a beam of this power at this spot'.
These goals will become less instructive and more descriptive as the player progresses.


Campaign Design
---------------
The campain structure reinforces the idea of the player being a new wizard being
taught the tricks of the trait. Thus, the highlevel structure of the campaign is 
a sequence of job titles:

Artificer in Training:
   This is the tutorial section for the game, which teaches the player about
   the beam magic with very specific puzzles. It should end with some kind
   of final exam or certification as Junior Artificer.
Junior Artificer
   This section focuses on beam magic in progressively more difficult structures.
   It consists of an initial section, but it splits up into sequences focussing 
   on the different energy types of beams. Each of these sequences awards the player
   with a badge "Mastery of the Water/Earth/Fire/Air-Beams". Once the player
   has all badges, he can start the course on "High Energy Beams" in order to
   become a certified Artificer.
Artificer
   As a certified Artificer, the player will have a number of tasks involving
   crossing beams, high energy beams and such. Once he has completed a sufficient
   number of levels, the player can enroll in the course for "Metal Processing".
   This course will require the player to use knowledge about beam crossing and
   high powered energy beams in order to power smeltrys and foundrys. Succesfully
   completing these courses awards the player the hat of a Master Artificer.
Master Artificer
   As the master artificer, the focus of the machines of the player shifts
   from beam manipulation, to actual item production and item enchantment. 
   At this point in the game, the beam mechanic should be established enough
   so it can be treated as a known tool.
Grand Artificer
   This level of play will contain challenge puzzles. They reuse all existing 
   mechanics in weird, challenging ways. Designing these levels will take tinkering
   with the game mechanics once implemented.

The Machine Building
--------------------

The machine building in Arcana happens on a variable size grid of quadratic tiles.
Different levels can have different sizes of grids, and the entire grid is not
necessarily quadratic.

The grid organizes and aligns two core components of Arcana: *mana blobs* and
*machines*. Mana blobs are the model of magical energy in the beam-based
puzzles of Arcana, and machines are used to manipulate these mana blobs.
